#Outline

High-Level Summary: Malaria is a disease that is estimated to have killed up to half of the world’s population over time and still wreaks havoc across the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In my final project, I would like to demonstrate how the malaria epidemic has changed in the last few decades based on certain interventions and financial resources and how we as citizens can advocate for interventions that are proven to be successful.

#Project Structure
1.	What is Malaria? A brief paragraph or two to help the audience all get on the same page. If the audience doesn’t believe that there are ways to effectively prevent and treat malaria, they will not be interested in hearing about the interventions.
2.	Malaria rates over time. Everyone has likely come across a map showing the prevalence of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and been gob smacked by how ubiquitous it seems to be; I don’t believe that a map like this represents the true picture of malaria. Rather, I’d like to show how the rates have changed over time. I have access to many years of data from multiple countries (for more information, see the Data section of this proposal), but before constructing visualizations, I’d like to better understand the data. At this point, I don’t know if it would be more effective to paint this picture as the story of a single country (fewer data points but an easier to track story) or multiple countries in the sub-Saharan region, which would show us more general trends but wouldn’t allow us to understand causality quite as much. I think it would also be likely possible to do it both ways, both a macro and a micro approach.
3.	A brief history of interventions and how they play a role in either malaria reduction or cost-reduction of malaria services. I want this presentation to not be too text heavy because I think a lot of times, stories about malaria are too text-heavy and not very engaging or fun to read. But I think with a disease like malaria, there needs to be a lot of background information so that the audience who may not be familiar with malaria may understand. 
4.	A combination of the malaria disease rates and the interventions history. What I’d like to do through this visualization is help display visually how certain interventions have changed malaria rates. I won’t be able to determine causality necessarily (unless the data include randomized control trials), but it will be exciting to show the reader how certain changes in policy have effected changes in the disease rate.
5.	Information on costs of programs. Some programs (free village-wide medication campaigns, for instance) are much more expensive than others (bed net distributions at the family level, for instance). However, there aren’t a ton of sources that examine the relationship between cost and efficacy. With a combination of 2, 3, and 4, I will be able to do that.
6.	A call to action: based on the results shown in 5, I will be able to suggest which interventions get the most bang for their back, to put it colloquially. I would like the audience to leave the presentation encouraged that certain cost-effective interventions are also life-saving and will be willing to call their congressperson to encourage them to support these interventions by increasing the amount of foreign aid appropriate in the next budget.

#The data 

Many great data sources exist that discuss malaria, but based on my initial research, I couldn’t find a singular resource that contained everything I was looking for to tell the story that I’d like to tell. So for this project I’ll be borrowing data from a few different credible resources.

The first data source is a really well-done visualization from Our World In Data. It shows the changes in the youth mortality rate from 1950-2017; unsurprisingly, there are very few data points for sub-Saharan Africa before 1980. The data demonstrate that devastatingly high mortality rates are observed primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, though they have diminished slightly in the last decade. Their data come from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Source: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality

For a slightly more granular look at each country, I turned to the World Health Organization Malaria Country profiles, with data from 2008-2018. Using this repository of data will allow me to focus on one specific country, if the story is better told that way as I believe it will be. Source: https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/en/

The United Nations is another agency deeply concerned with the malaria epidemic. They have great data on percentage of deaths caused by malaria in children under the age of  (U5 mortality is often one of the most highly-correlated statistics with how well a country is doing). This data set will help me illustrate the point that malaria is endemic and the treatment of malaria deserves significant funding. Source: https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/malaria/

One piece that I’d like to tie in graphically that I haven’t yet seen is how interventions fit into the overall timeline of malaria prevention. To do this, I am going to rely on a report to Congress from the President’s Malaria Initiative from 2016. (Unfortunately, malaria eradication efforts seem to not be as highly-publicized in this administration…) The report, titled “A Decade of Progress,” is certainly written with the intent to lionize the United States’ efforts to eradicate malaria and is tinted with self-affirming language. However, the interventions discussed are factual and should be considered. Source: https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pmi-reports/pmi-tenth-annual-report-congress.pdf

One problem with relying on the PMI report is that the United States isn’t the only country engaging in great work. The Global Fund, the Gates Foundation, the UN, the WHO, and many more organizations are also doing their part to prevent and treat malaria. It is irresponsible to say that a reduction in malaria is due to the actions of one country or group without understanding the other groups’ work. For this problem, I will need to come up with a creative way to incorporate other reports or include the caveat that correlation does not equal causation, and just because the US stepped up its efforts in a certain place does not mean that other efforts were not also scaled up or even scaled back. 

Another problem with the above data sets is that very few of them take into account other confounding factors. A country that experiences a particularly heavy rainy season or a famine may see higher rates of malaria that I won’t be able to factor in using the data above. Before I finish the project, I want to consider adding in more information without overwhelming the audience; here I would be very grateful for suggestions!

Finally, I am hoping to take a GIS course in the spring, and when that happens, I would like to update this project to include some GIS data. There are many malaria databases for GIS at this source: https://map.ox.ac.uk/

#Methods

My plan for the final project is to create a presentation using Shorthand. I believe that I can use the platform to build the story that I’d like to tell, starting (as the outline says) from the general “What is Malaria” and “Whom does it affect” and building to the very specific call to action about which specific interventions should be advocated for at the federal level.

Something I would like to clarify (which will likely come as I explore the data and begin building my own visualizations) is how best to tell the story. Should I use sub-Saharan Africa as a semi-homogenous unit? Should I focus my story on one country; perhaps Togo, where I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer? Would limiting to one country (for which the data certainly exist) take away too much from the story? Would focusing on many countries dampen the overall takeaways? It is irresponsible to say that the many countries that make up sub-Saharan Africa are all similar. But focusing on one country allows a particular catastrophic event (a drought, a civil war, etc.) tarnish the malaria-related data. 

I could also tell two stories: A story about a particular country and then how that particular puzzle piece fits into the overall picture. What I worry about in this two-pronged approach is overwhelming the audience. I want the final project to be easy to read; the subject material is already heavy enough that making the project too long might prevent some people from finishing it. 

I also need to figure out how much the average reader for this project understands malaria. It’s possible that people don’t know how endemic it is, or what the cause is, or how it is transmitted (unlike most illnesses, malaria is vector-borne: a person cannot give it to another person, but an infected person can infect a mosquito, who can then infect another person. It’s a subtle but crucial difference). I’m excited to test the iterations of my project with people who aren’t familiar with malaria to see what I need to simplify and what I can remove.
